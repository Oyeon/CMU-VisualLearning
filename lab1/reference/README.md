# hw1

We strongly suggest using conda (or miniconda) for package management. We wrote this assignment using a conda environment with python 3.7, but using a later version should work too.

If you follow our AWS tutorial to setup the EC2 instance, you can then use the following commands to setup the hw1's conda environment.

```shell
conda create -n cmu16824hw1 python=3.7
conda activate cmu16824hw1
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install opencv-python
```
